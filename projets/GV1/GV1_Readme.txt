   ADB's Games Volume 1
  **********************

   Thanks for downloading this off of Aminet.org (or wherever you got it
   from). These are the first 2 games I made in AMOS and are just test
   games really. I did some programming on my ZX Spectrum back in the
   early 90's, but those games turned out crap!
   These test games turned out pretty good and since making these I
   have made more games and software using AMOS Basic.


   All the following files should be on a disk, called "Games_Vol1",
   which must be inserted into drive DF0 (internal 3.5" DD drive).
   Do not forget to install the disk (go to execute command in workbench
   and type "install df0:") before copying the files across or it won't
   auto-boot from startup. You can click on the icon files to start the
   games, or intro file, from workbench.
